If you're referring to a `config.txt` in the root of a Yocto-generated image, it might be a custom file added by your specific project or by the BSP (Board Support Package) layer you are using.

In a Yocto Project build, you can find configuration files related to the Linux kernel and boot process in the `boot` directory inside the image. The location could be something like `tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/boot/`.
